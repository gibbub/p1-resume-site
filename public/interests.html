    <b>Illustration & Design</b><br/>
    <p>
        I loved to draw since I was a child. Making art is something I take seriously, but is also something I have fun with and enjoy greatly!<br/>
        Visual storytelling is what my love of art and design boils down to. Graphic novels and animation are the most literal form of visual storytelling,
        but even a website or logo design can convey a story or message to its user, and this is what I find most interesting about design as a whole.<br/>
        Color, shape, placement of elements, and other visual aspects of a design can change so much about how a user interacts and interprets that design, and I love to explore and experiment with such aspects.

    <b>Music, Guitar, & Violin</b><br/>
    <p>
        I love finding new music and making my own simple songs on occassion!<br/>
        I began learning how to read and play music on violin throughout my middle- and high-school years, and on occassion still play.<br/>
        Currently I have been trying to teach myself guitar and enjoy playing along with existing songs as well as jamming on my own or with friends.
